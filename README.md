# Hi there, I'm Drake
**Engineering Student | Logistics Professional | Building Systems**

I'm an Engineering student at the Open University and a full-time professional working in logistics. This GitHub is my public workshop - documenting projects, learning, and building useful systems.

## Current Focus
- Completing my Engineering degree (Open University)
- Further my knowledge in computers, programming, automation and tooling
- Building mental models for engineering and problem-solving
- Strengthening core maths + physics foundation
- Developing real engineering/software projects for my portfolio

## Tech & Tools I'm Working With
- Python, C/CPP, SQL
- Git & GitHub, Bash, Linux
- Markdown, LaTeX for engineering notes
- HTML/CSS/JS
- WSL, Windows

## Featured Projects (coming soon)

### Auth & Authorisation
Shared identity & access control service:
- user accounts and role-based access control
- API keys, OAuth, SSO integrations
- permission scoping (dispatcher/driver/admin)
- audit logs and session management

### Customer Management System
CRUD service for customer data and SLAs, including:
- customer profiles and contacts
- contract / SLA definitions
- billing addresses and service tiers
- account activity history

### Fleet & Asset Management
Manage vehicles and equipment with:
- vehicle specs (capacity, dimensions, fuel type)
- trailer/equipment linking and availability
- maintenance records and scheduling
- geo-fencing & operational restrictions

### Driver & Crew Management
Roster and compliance system for crews:
- driver profiles and certifications
- shifts, availability, and hours-of-service rules
- licensing and compliance checks
- shift handovers and assignments

### Order / Job Management API
A core API for creating and tracking transport jobs, supporting:
- pickups & deliveries (locations, time windows)
- job priorities and statuses
- recurring & bulk import of orders
- validation & address normalisation

### Route Optimisation Engine
Constraint-driven routing service using OR-Tools:
- multi-stop route planning
- time windows, capacities, and vehicle types
- customisable cost functions (time, distance, fuel)
- batch optimisation and solution export

### Scheduling & Dispatch Engine
Decision layer that assigns work and sequences tasks:
- match jobs to vehicles/drivers
- shift-aware scheduling and sequencing
- manual overrides and dispatch workflows
- dispatch notifications and change logs

### Constraint Management
Rule engine for business logic and exceptions:
- encode hard/soft constraints and priorities
- dynamic overrides and feature flags
- validation before optimisation runs
- rule auditing and versioning

### Event & Status Engine
State machine for operational events:
- milestone events (loaded, en route, delivered)
- automated state transitions and alerts
- exception detection and escelation paths
- event audit trail for compliance

### Costing & Pricing Engine
Calculate route and job economics:
- per-route cost models (fuel, time, tolls)
- dynamic pricing and rate cards
- cost attribution to customers/jobs
- exportable cost reports for billing

### Billing & Invoicing
Automate billing flows tied to deliveries:
- invoice generation from completed jobs
- rate rules, discounts, and surcharges
- multi-currency and tax handling
- payment status tracking and reconciliations

### Always Improving

I'm building my life around long-term systems: clear thinking, strong foundation, engineering discipline, financial stability, and meaningful personal growth. Everything here is a work in progress. Some projects will succeed, others will teach me why they failed. Both outcomes are valuable.

This GitHub documents that journey.
