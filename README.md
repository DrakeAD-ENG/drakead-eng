# Hi there, I'm Drake

I'm an Engineering student at the Open University and a full-time professional working in logistics. I'm building a strong foundation in engineering principles, mathematics, programming, and systems design.

My interests span: Engineering, Software Development, Automation, Problem-Solving, Long-Term Personal Growth, Simulations, Human Life, Philosophy, Psychology, History.

This GitHub serves as my digital workspace:
- Engineering + software project
- Learning notes (maths, programming, engineering, environments, etc.)
- Essays, reflections, and structured thinking
- Portfolio & CV
- Long-term study, habits, and skill development

---

## Current Focus
- Completing my Engineering degree (Open University)
- Further my knowledge in computers, programming, automation and tooling
- Building mental models for engineering and problem-solving
- Strengthening core maths + physics foundation
- Developing real engineering/software projects for my portfolio
- Improving finances, personal systems, organisation, and workflows

---

## Tech & Tools I'm Working With
- Python, C/CPP, SQL
- Git & GitHub, Bash, Linux
- Markdown, LaTeX for engineering notes
- HTML/CSS/JS
- WSL, Windows

### Always Improving

I'm building my life around long-term systems: clear thinking, strong foundation, engineering discipline, financial stability, and meaningful personal growth.

This GitHub documents that journey.
